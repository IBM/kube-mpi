These directories provide examples of a kube-mpi controller for OpenMPI. They have been tested on OpenShift but should be portable to any kubernetes cluster. The examples support hostNetwork: True | False. In both cases, the mpirun command substitutes ssh with kssh (alias of kubectl) to start the ORTED in pods across the cluster. Each application tasks waits until all tasks are scheduled by the default kubernetes scheduler. At that time, an mpi controller executes mpirun.
